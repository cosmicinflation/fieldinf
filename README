This package compiles and install FieldInf, a collection of fast
modern fortran routines for integrating, out of any approximations,
linear cosmological perturbations during inflation.

As such, it provides an exact integration of the primordial power
spectra, computed in a way which is consistent with the reheating, as
well as various other background and perturbed quantities (check out
the two example programs provided). Moreover, it supports libaspic and
you can compare slow-roll versus exact predictions.

The code is released as GNU software, you are free and welcome to
improve this code and distribute the source code along the rules
specified in COPYING.

* Compilation and installation of the FieldInf library:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  
* Support for libaspic is provided by appending its installation path
  to the configure script:
  ./configure --with-aspic=/usr/local
  make
  make install

  See INSTALL for more options.

* Compilation of the tutorial programs (fieldmain and gurumain):
  ./configure
  make check

* A basic and easily editable makefile is provided in the "src/"
  directory to fastly compile the example programs locally:
  make -f Makefile_noauto

* Checkout the MAN pages for a complete documentation (TODO)
  man fieldinf
