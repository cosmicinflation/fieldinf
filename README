**********************************************************************
This is an addon module for CAMB/cosmoMC which computes the
primordial power spectra by an exact numerical integration of some
standard one field inflationary models. It implements reheating
through the "reheating parameter" R allowing robust inflationary
parameter estimations and inference on the reheating energy scale. The
underlying perturbation code actually deals with N fields
minimally-coupled and/or non-minimally coupled to gravity. Works for
flat FLRW only.

-These patches modify the cosmomc or camb codes and therefore may have
bugs that are not present in the originals. The authors of the
original versions should not be bothered with problems resulting in
the use of these patches. Feel free to insult me, or at least contact
me, in case of bugs!

-Apply the patch in the cosmomc/ directory:

patch -p1 < purpose_DDMMYY.patch

-See astro-ph/0509727, astro-ph/0605367, astro-ph/0703486, arXiv:1004.5525

-Please note that the genuine Makefiles have been heavily changed and
may require edition to work on your system. They assume the existence
of a directory "cosmomc/WMAP" which points to the WMAP team likelihood
code directory. The WMAP data are also assumed to reside in the
"cosmomc/data" directory.

**********************************************************************

Basic controls are included in the cosmomc "params.ini" file and
consist on choosing an inflationary model and specifying the prior
range on its potential parameters. The CAMB control file, of the same
name, includes a detailed interface to the inflationary module.

The inflation code itself is in the sub-directory "fieldinf" and a
short description of the relevant files is given in the following.

*infbgmodel.f90

Contains the encoded inflationary potentials together with their
short-name. If you need to add a model, this starts there.

*infsrmodel.F90

Contains routines to solve the slow-roll approximated equations for
each of the above mentioned model. This is used only to provide a
guess (optional) of the initial field values producing a numerically
optimal *total* number of e-folds of inflation (long enough to perform
computations on the attractor, but not too long to spare computing
time). Additional "hard" theoretical priors on the allowed field
values are coded in this file.

*infbg.f90

Integrates the field and metric background from given values of the
potential parameters and initial conditions. The function
"set_infbg_ini" is precisely calling the routines of "infsrmodel.f90",
but only if you set all initial field value to 0. Otherwise, the
background is computed from the input initial field value. A lot of
tunable options can be set in the function "bg_field_evol" to specify
how inflation ends, to explore parametric oscillations...

*infpert.f90

Integrates the perturbations in Fourier space over the previously
computed background. For each perturbation mode, you get the tensor
and scalar power spectra.

*inftorad.f90

Contains all routines needed to relate the inflationary era to the
radiation era by means of the reheating parameter R. Extra assumptions
on reheating can be fixed there.


*power_inf.f90

This is the interface between CAMB and the inflationary code. It feeds
CAMB with each perturbation mode.  It contains various optimisations,
tests for hard priors. A spline of the power spectra is switched on
by the boolean "useSplineDefault". The range and number of points are
set in the routine "SetDefPowerParams".

**********************************************************************

All source files contain the switches "display" and "dump_files" which
can be used for debugging. They output data at various stages of the
computation. Mind that they slow down a lot the execution and you
don't want to use them for production runs.
