# FieldInf: an exact solver for linear cosmological perturbations during inflation

---

### Summary

This package compiles and install
[**FieldInf**](https://curl.irmp.ucl.ac.be/~chris/fieldinf.html), a
collection of fast modern fortran routines for integrating, out of any
approximations, linear cosmological perturbations during inflation.

As such, it provides an exact integration of the primordial power
spectra, computed in a way which is consistent with the reheating, as
well as various other background and perturbed quantities (check out
the two example programs provided). Moreover, it supports libaspic and
you can compare slow-roll versus exact predictions.

### Installation

The code is released as GNU software, you are free and welcome to
improve this code and distribute the source code along the rules
specified in COPYING.

Compilation and installation of the **FieldInf** library:

```bash
   ./configure
   make
   make install
```

Support for [**libaspic**](https://curl.irmp.ucl.ac.be/~chris/aspic.html) is
provided by appending its installation path to the configure script:

```bash
   ./configure --with-aspic=/usr/local make make install
```
See INSTALL for more options.

Compilation of the tutorial programs (**fieldmain** and **gurumain**):

```bash
   ./configure
   make check
```

A basic and easily editable makefile is provided in the "src/"
directory to fastly compile the example programs locally:

```bash
   make -f Makefile_noauto
```
